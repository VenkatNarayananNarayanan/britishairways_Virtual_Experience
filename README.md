I Completed British Airways'Data Science Virtual Experience Programme' at Forage, where I learned about web scraping, text, and sentiment analysis on a real-world dataset and developed a predictive model. It was a great experience to get some insights into what interns at BA may work on in relation to #dataanalysis, model creation, and insight generation. During this program, I had the opportunity to work on two interesting tasks.


Task 1 :

Scrape data from the web :

The first thing I did in the task was to scrape review data from the web they gave. I was collecting as much data as I can in order to improve the output of your analysis. To get started with the data collection, I used the “Jupyter Notebook” in the Resources section below to run some Python code that will help to collect some data.

Analyse data:

Once I have done with the dataset collection, I started to prepare it by analyzing the data. The data was very messy and contain pure text. so I performed data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, I performed my own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, I look at topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews and ended up with visualisations that helps to solve the business questions that I created on my own for the given dataset to the better understanding and analyzing of the dataset.

Present insights:

In the end, I summarised the findings within a single PowerPoint slide and I included all visualisations and metrics within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from my analysis. 

Task 2:

Explore and prepare the dataset :

Train a machine learning model:

Evaluate model and present findings:
