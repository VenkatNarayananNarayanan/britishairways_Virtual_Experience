Task 1 :

Scrape data from the web :

The first thing I did in the task was to scrape review data from the web they gave. I was collecting as much data as I can in order to improve the output of your analysis. To get started with the data collection, I used the “Jupyter Notebook” in the Resources section below to run some Python code that will help to collect some data.

Analyse data:

Once I have done with the dataset collection, I started to prepare it by analyzing the data. The data was very messy and contain pure text. so I performed data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, I performed my own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, I look at topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews and ended up with visualisations that helps to solve the business questions that I created on my own for the given dataset to the better understanding and analyzing of the dataset.

Present insights:

In the end, I summarised the findings within a single PowerPoint slide and I included all visualisations and metrics within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from my analysis. 

Task 2:

Explore and prepare the dataset :

First, I spent some time exploring the given customer booking dataset in the Jupyter Notebook to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then,  I prepared the dataset for a predictive model. I looked into the dataset to find out where there is any need for new features I want to create in order to make the model even better.

Train a machine learning model:

After my data is ready for modeling, I trained a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, I used an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. where I experimented with three algorithms which are Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. By comparing all the algorithms a RandomForest is very good for this purpose.


Evaluate the model and present findings:

After training the model, I evaluated the model how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics(accuracy_score,f1 score, precision score, and recall score). Furthermore, I created a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, I summarised the findings in a single slide and I included all visualisations and metrics within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from my analysis.
