       "\" |  Flew Marseille to London. Absolutely terrible service. Flight delayed four hours. Check-in staff rude and arrogant and didn't explain the delay. Plane was not that clean. The one consolation was the pilot coming out of the cockpit to apologise about the delay and offered the opportunity for passengers to view the inside of the cockpit. For the money they charge you can get better service elsewhere. I would recommend using other airlines personally.\""
